            <h2>Anxiety is a normal part of life.</h2>
            <p>
                Everyone experiences worry or fear at times, especially during stressful situations like exams, job interviews, or major life changes. However, when anxiety becomes overwhelming, persistent, or interferes with daily functioning, it may indicate an anxiety disorder.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health conditions worldwide, affecting millions of people each year. Understanding their types, symptoms, and coping strategies is the first step toward effective management and recovery.
            </p>

            <h2>What Are Anxiety Disorders?</h2>
            <p>
                Anxiety disorders involve excessive fear or worry that is difficult to control and goes beyond normal, temporary stress. This anxiety often causes significant distress and impacts a person’s ability to work, study, or maintain relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
                The difference between normal anxiety and anxiety disorders lies in:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intensity</strong> – The fear or worry is much stronger than the situation calls for.</li>
                <li><strong>Duration</strong> – The feelings last for weeks or months rather than a short time.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact</strong> – The anxiety disrupts daily activities and quality of life.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Types of Anxiety Disorders</h2>

                Anxiety disorders are treatable. With the right approach, many people experience significant improvement. Treatment often combines self-care, therapy, and, in some cases, medication.
            </p>

                <li>Break tasks into small steps to avoid feeling overwhelmed.</li>
            </ul>
